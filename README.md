🧠 I’m currently trying to create a strong foundation for ML/AI by following courses from MIT, Stanford OCW.
  
🪖 When I was serving in the army as a MEBS (Information and Electronics Systems) officer I created a platform to share non-confidential, technical information between Turkish officers and NCOs which is **cozumdefteri.com** (still there but not actively used anymore).  
  
⚖️ I made a WebApp to create official (Turkish) petitions with ease, **seridilekce.com** This website helps people create their formal petition (dilekçe) simply by filling textbox, and the site serves the created petition according to formal rules in the pdf form, since its creation **tens of thousands** petitions are created and the site is still actively being used.

⚙️ I made a desktop app **Nebim Dönüştürücü** for a private company so the images of the products and their namings would be compatible to be uploaded in the ERP software ('Nebim').  

And there are many other projects at this page, open source, hoping would be beneficial for whatever you are building or planning to build.
