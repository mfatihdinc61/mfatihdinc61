-------
🧠 I’m currently trying to create a strong foundation for ML/AI by following courses from MIT, Stanford OCW, spending hours (sometimes days) to internalize some terms and architectures as I experience that unlike being a web developer, AI/ML-related professions require understanding the essence of the branch that the models are built on.

🪖 When I was serving in the army as a MEBS (Information and Electronics Systems) officer I created a platform to share non-confidential, technical information between Turkish officers and NCOs which is **cozumdefteri.com** (still there but not actively used anymore).
-------
  
⚖️ WebApp to create official (Turkish) petitions with ease, **seridilekce.com** This website helps people create their formal petition (dilekçe) simply by filling textboxs, and the site serves the created petition according to formal rules in the pdf form, since its creation **tens of thousands** petitions are created and the site is still actively being used. This is a non-profit website with no ads, merely aiming to smooth the writing petition process and encourage people to use their civil rights.
